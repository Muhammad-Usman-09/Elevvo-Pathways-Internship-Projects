💰 Loan Approval Prediction

📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be **Approved** or **Rejected**.

📊 Dataset
    - Features: Dependents, Education, Employment, Income, Loan Amount, CIBIL score, Assets, etc.
    - Target: `loan_status`

🔧 Steps Taken
    - Data preprocessing (categorical encoding, handling missing values)
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (Distribution plots, Countplots)
    - Applied Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
    - Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

🏆 Results
    - CIBIL Score and Loan Amount were the most influential features
    - Random Forest gave the best classification accuracy
